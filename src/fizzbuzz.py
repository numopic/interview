# === FizzBuzz ===
#
# Given an integer `n`, return a list of strings where:
# 
# 1. The list starts at 1 and has `n` elements.
# 2. Element `i` is the string representation of `i`;
#   - except when `i` is divisible by 3, in which case it should be "Fizz";
#   - except when `i` is divisible by 5, in which case it should be "Buzz";
#   - except when `i` is divisible by both 3 and 5, in which case it should be "FizzBuzz".
#
# Example 1:
# Input: n = 3
# Output: ["1", "2", "Fizz"]
#
# Example 2:
# Input: n = 5
# Output: ["1", "2", "Fizz" ,"4" ,"Buzz"]
#
# Example 3:
# Input: n = 15
# Output: ["1", "2", "Fizz", "4", "Buzz", "Fizz", "7", "8", "Fizz", "Buzz", "11", "Fizz", "13", "14", "FizzBuzz"]
